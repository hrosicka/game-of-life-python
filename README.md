This repository contains Python implementations of Conway's Game of Life, a classic cellular automaton simulation.

## Features

- Simulates well-known Game of Life patterns such as:
  - Pulsar
  - Toad
- Entirely written in Python
- Ready-to-run scripts for visualizing these patterns step by step

## Repository Structure

- `game-of-life-pulsar.py` – Script for simulating the Pulsar pattern
- `game-of-life-toad.py` – Script for simulating the Toad pattern

## Requirements

- Python 3.x

## Running the Simulations

You can run a simulation by executing the script for the desired pattern. For example:
```bash
python game-of-life-pulsar.py
```
or
```bash
python game-of-life-toad.py
```

Follow the instructions in the terminal to view the evolution of each automaton.

## About Conway's Game of Life

Conway's Game of Life is a zero-player game in which an initial state evolves step by step according to simple rules, leading to a variety of complex behaviors.
